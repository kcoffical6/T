This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

I'll help you set up the admin panel with all the essential features. Here's a comprehensive plan:

1. **Core Features**:
   - User Authentication & Authorization
   - Dashboard with Analytics
   - Bookings Management
   - Customer Management
   - Driver Management
   - Vehicle Management
   - Reports & Analytics

2. **Technical Stack**:
   - Frontend: Next.js 13+ with App Router
   - UI: Shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
   - State Management: Redux Toolkit
   - API: Axios with interceptors
   - Authentication: JWT with refresh tokens
   - Form Handling: React Hook Form + Zod

3. **File Structure**:

   ```
   src/
   ├── app/
   │   ├── (auth)/
   │   ├── (dashboard)/
   │   │   ├── bookings/
   │   │   ├── customers/
   │   │   ├── drivers/
   │   │   ├── vehicles/
   │   │   └── reports/
   │   └── api/
   ├── components/
   │   ├── ui/           # Shadcn components
   │   ├── layout/       # Layout components
   │   └── features/     # Feature-specific components
   ├── features/         # Feature slices
   ├── lib/              # Utils, config, API clients
   └── types/            # Global TypeScript types
   ```

4. **Next Steps**:
   - Set up protected routes
   - Create API services
   - Implement data tables with server-side pagination
   - Add form validation
   - Set up error boundaries
   - Add loading states

Would you like me to start implementing any specific part of this? For example:

1. Set up protected routes and authentication flow
2. Create the bookings management page
3. Implement the dashboard with real data
4. Something else?
